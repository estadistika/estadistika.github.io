/estadistika/ is the Filipino word for Statistics, and is the name of this personal blog authored by me, Al Asaad.
I made this blog to share my passion/interest on statistics, data science and machine/deep learning.
I'm a Data Scientist at a startup company with Master of Science in Statistics from University of the Philippines Diliman.
