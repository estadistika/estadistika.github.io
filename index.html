    <h1 class="post-title">Welcome!</h1>
    /estadistika/ is the Filipino word for Statistics, and is the core topic of this blog. My name is <a href="https://alstat.github.io/" target="_blank">Al Asaad</a> and I'm the author -- Data Scientist at NeuralMechanics, Inc. (see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-ahmadgaid-asaad-68613a44/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>). I made this blog to share my thoughts about Data Science, Machine/Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence with emphasis on the use of Statistics in these evolving fields. Needless to say, everything I post here represents my views and not the opinion of my employer.
    Moreover, I am also the owner of the [Analysis with Programming](http://alstatr.blogspot.com/) website, which I maintained from 2013 to 2017, and I made this blog as a successor to it. You can contact me at
