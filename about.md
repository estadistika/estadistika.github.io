/estadistika/ is the Filipino/Spanish word for Statistics, and is the core topic of this blog. My name is [Al Asaad](https://alstat.github.io/) and I'm the author. I made this blog in order to share my thoughts on topics such as Data Science, Machine/Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence with emphasis on the use of Statistics in these evolving fields. I am also the owner of the [Analysis with Programming](http://alstatr.blogspot.com/) website, and I made this blog as the successor to it.

I'm an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, [Iligan Institute of Technology of the Mindanao State University](https://msuiit.edu.ph/). I previously worked as a Data Scientist on two startup companies before joining the academe (see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-ahmadgaid-asaad-68613a44/)), and needless to say, everything I post here does not represent the views of my employer.


Finally, I am open for private consultation (data science, biostatistics, econometrics, social statistics, etc.) and collaborative projects especially open-source (see my projects on [Github](https://github.com/alstat)). You can contact me at al-ahmadgaid.asaad@g.msuiit.edu.ph or follow me on twitter [@realalstat](https://twitter.com/realalstat).
