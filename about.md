/estadistika/ is the Filipino/Spanish word for Statistics, and is the core topic of this blog. My name is [Al Asaad](https://alstat.github.io/) and I'm the author. I'm a Data Scientist at NeuralMechanics, Inc. (see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-ahmadgaid-asaad-68613a44/)). I made this blog to share my thoughts about Data Science, Machine/Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence with emphasis on the use of Statistics in these evolving fields. Needless to say, everything I post here represents my views and not the opinion of my employer.

Moreover, I am also the owner of the [Analysis with Programming](http://alstatr.blogspot.com/) website, which I maintained from 2013 to 2017, and I made this blog as a successor to it. You can contact me at
