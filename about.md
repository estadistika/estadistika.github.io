/estadistika/ is the Filipino word for Statistics, and is the core topic of this blog. My name is <a href="https://alstat.github.io/" target="_blank">Al Asaad</a> -- 
Data Scientist at <a href="http://neuralmechanics.net/" target="_blank">NeuralMechanics, Inc.</a> 
(see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-ahmadgaid-asaad-68613a44/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>) --
and I'm the editor-in-cheif. Unless otherwise stated, some of the articles, especially on the frequentist approach to time series analyses, will be a 
joint work with <a href="https://alstat.github.io/" target="_blank">Minnette Lois Morales</a> -- a trend analyst at <a href="https://www.manilawater.com/" target="_blank">Manila Water Company, Inc.</a> 
(see her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-ahmadgaid-asaad-68613a44/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>).
     
I made this blog to share my thoughts about Data Science, Machine/Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence with emphasis on the use of Statistics. This also serves as my notes for possible research I want to pursue in the future. Needless to say, everything I post here represents my views and not the opinions of my employer.

I'm a statistician by training, and my research interest is in the field of Bayesian inference for Big data and its application to deep learning models, both for computer vision and natural language processing.

Lastly, I am also the owner of the <a href="http://alstatr.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Analysis with Programming</a> website, which I maintained from 2013 to 2017, and I made /estadistika/ as a successor to it. You can contact me at
